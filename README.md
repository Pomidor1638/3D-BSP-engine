# 3D-BSP-engine

This crap was written in dark times when I didn’t know about OpenGL and the C language. There are no textures or proper collision handling (it was there, but I lost the code and I'm not going to restore or rewrite it). The save system is incomplete, and I've already forgotten the map format. For a program without textures and proper graphics, it runs very slowly. This was one of my first attempts to create an engine. Just me, just Python, and just math.

To run it, you need pygame. There’s a config, but it’s poorly parsed, so it’s better not to touch it.
